# Flood defense game

The idea is to teach about systems thinking by getting people to understand causal links and feedback loops.

## Rules

- Flooding is dependent on the flow of the river, which is dependent on the width and height of the river, which is higher when it rains or flow is higher upstream
    - There is a random chance of it raining each
        - the probability increases with each day that it doesn't rain
        - the chance is highest in winter and lowest in summer
- The water table 
- You can do things to affect the flow of the river
    - weirs
    - conrollable weirs
    - plant trees
    - flood planes
    - build wetlands
    - restore original river routes
    - dredging
    - introduce beavers (can only do his where you have built wetlands)
- You can build defenses to protect towns from flooding
    - flood walls
    - sand bags
